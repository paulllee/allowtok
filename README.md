picture this:

you are someone that doesn't have tiktok installed on your phone for *reasons*

a friend of yours sends you a link to a tiktok that they found funny

you decide to click on it and it redirects you to your mobile browser

harmless, you decide to click to play buttom and bam, redirects you to the app
store asking you to install tiktok

annoyed, you tried to figure out how to still watch tiktoks and stumbled upon
https://www.reddit.com/r/Tiktokhelp/comments/1cxeaf6/comment/l5cmpow/

what a blessing but it still is annoying to have to open up these tiktoks and
to manually edit the timestamps out of the query string every time

so this was born. extremely simple web app to redirect you to a tiktok link
without the timestamps so it just works
